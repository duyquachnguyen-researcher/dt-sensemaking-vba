Final Summary (Tasks 1–20)
==========================

Task 1: Convergence on Impact vs Implementability
- Impact scores are more dispersed than implementability (higher mean/median SDy vs SDx), with a significant paired difference (p≈0.011).
- Interpretation: participants agree more on feasibility than on impact magnitude.

Task 2: Consensus Zones on the Grid
- Placements cluster into a few hotspots: 39/49 cells used, with the top 5 cells holding ~33% of placements.
- Two dominant zones are (4,7) and (6,2), each with 23 placements.
- Interpretation: a small number of grid regions act as consensus anchors rather than a uniform spread.

Task 3: Highest Agreement Statements
- Exact agreement is modest (mean ~31%), but several statements exceed 40–53% exact agreement.
- Allowing a 1-cell radius lifts agreement substantially (mean ~44%, top statements ~80–86%).
- Interpretation: perfect consensus is rare, but practical alignment is common within a tight neighborhood.

Task 4: Most Controversial Statements
- Average controversy score is high (~1.55 grid units from centroid), indicating broad dispersion.
- The highest-controversy items include "Protect 2 hours/week for learning" and "Celebrate a tiny win every Friday."
- Interpretation: disagreement concentrates on a subset of statements rather than being evenly distributed.

Task 5: Axis-Specific Disagreement
- 3 statements are implementability-driven, 8 are impact-driven, and 8 are balanced.
- Impact-driven disagreement is more common, highlighting where impact perceptions diverge most.
- Interpretation: impact judgments drive more variability than implementability on many statements.

Task 6: High-Impact / Hard-to-Implement
- Only one statement falls into this quadrant: "Set an escalation SLA for unresolved blockers" (mean_x=2.43, mean_y=6.50).
- Interpretation: very few ideas are seen as both highly impactful and hard to implement.

Task 7: Easy-to-Implement / Low-Impact
- No statements meet the easy/low-impact criteria.
- Interpretation: even the easiest actions are still perceived to carry meaningful impact.

Task 8: Theme Mapping (Seed Statements)
- Four themes emerge; "Coordinate across teams and unblock" sits highest on impact with lower implementability.
- "Make the goal concrete" attracts the most placements and sits near the center of the grid.
- Interpretation: coordination themes are viewed as impactful but harder, while concreteness themes are more balanced.

Task 9: Participant Mapping Styles
- Average participant placement trends: mean_x≈4.68, mean_y≈4.89 with a 36% high-high tendency.
- A few participants show strong high-high clustering, while others are more variable.
- Interpretation: participants differ in optimism/ambition, with some strongly emphasizing high impact/feasibility.

Task 10: Participant Extremity & Consistency
- Average extremity rate is ~33%, with notable outliers above 50% edge placements.
- Within-person dispersion varies; a few participants are highly consistent while others show wide spread.
- Interpretation: some participants systematically favor extremes or show tight clustering, shaping consensus patterns.

Task 11: Participant Profile Clustering
- Two clusters are identified; one small cluster of 2 participants stands apart from the rest.
- Silhouette scores favor k=2; gap statistic is inconclusive but supports this split.
- Interpretation: most participants cluster into a dominant shared profile, with a small distinct subgroup.

Task 12: (No summary file provided)
- Interpretation pending; outputs for Task 12 were not found in the outputs folder.

Task 13: Function Differences
- No significant differences by function (Kruskal-Wallis p>0.4 for X, p>0.79 for Y).
- Operations shows the largest centroid distances vs several functions.
- Interpretation: function-level differences exist but are not statistically strong overall.

Task 14: Country Differences
- Significant differences across countries (p≈0.005 for X, p≈0.004 for Y).
- Largest gaps involve France, Singapore, and Thailand.
- Interpretation: national context appears to shape perceptions of impact and implementability.

Task 15: Role Level Differences
- No meaningful differences across role levels (p≈0.92 for X, p≈0.70 for Y).
- Centroid gaps are small (<0.5).
- Interpretation: seniority does not strongly explain placement patterns.

Task 16: Tenure vs Implementability/Impact
- Tenure correlates weakly with implementability (r=-0.14) and moderately with impact (r=0.42), but only extremity is significant (r=0.53, p≈0.033).
- Interpretation: longer tenure aligns with more extreme placements rather than systematically higher/lower scores.

Task 17: Hybrid% vs Placement Patterns
- Hybrid% is negatively correlated with implementability (r=-0.52) and positively with impact (r=0.60), both significant.
- Statement-level correlations show strong alignment on specific items.
- Interpretation: higher hybrid exposure shifts perceptions toward higher impact but lower feasibility.

Task 18: Raw vs Seed Placement Differences
- Raw placements skew higher on both axes than seeds (mean differences ≈ +0.9 to +1.1).
- Raw placements are less dispersed on impact than seeds, but similar extremity rates.
- Interpretation: raw ideas trend more optimistic (higher impact/feasibility) than curated seed statements.

Task 19: Raw Theme Mapping
- Communication & Change dominates placements; most themes cluster high on impact.
- People & Resourcing shows lower implementability with similar impact.
- Interpretation: raw ideas heavily emphasize communication, with some resource/process themes seen as harder to execute.

Task 20: Raw vs Seed Alignment
- All 71 raw statements map to a seed; 55 reinforce, 16 are mixed, none contradict.
- Mean distance to nearest seed is ~1.24 cells, indicating close alignment.
- Interpretation: raw submissions largely reinforce seed priorities with limited divergence.

Overall Insight
- Consensus is stronger on feasibility than impact, with clustered agreement zones and only a few high-controversy items.
- Participant factors (tenure, hybrid exposure, country) explain more variation than role or function.
- Raw ideas align closely with seed priorities but skew more optimistic on both axes.
