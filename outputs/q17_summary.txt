Q17 Hybrid% vs Placement Patterns Summary
========================================
Participants included: 16
Average hybrid%: 21.56
Median hybrid%: 0.00
Average placements per participant: 21.81

Average participant tendencies
-------------------------------
Mean implementability (x): 4.68
Mean impact (y): 4.89
Average extremity rate: 32.35%

Hybrid% correlations (Pearson r)
--------------------------------
Hybrid% vs mean implementability (x): r = -0.52, p = 0.037
Hybrid% vs mean impact (y): r = 0.60, p = 0.013
Hybrid% vs extremity rate: r = 0.43, p = 0.098
P-values use a Fisher z approximation (two-tailed).

Statement sensitivity (hybrid% vs placements)
---------------------------------------------
Top statements where hybrid% aligns with implementability (x):
- Share three user stories that embody the goal (n=14, r = -0.97, p = 0.000)
- Protect 2 hours/week for learning tied to the goal (n=14, r = 0.93, p = 0.000)
- Invite skeptics to a structured Q&A (n=14, r = -0.81, p = 0.000)
- Provide role-based “what changes for me” cards (n=14, r = -0.75, p = 0.001)
- Use a single channel for official goal updates (n=15, r = 0.62, p = 0.012)

Top statements where hybrid% aligns with impact (y):
- Pin the latest goal post at the top (n=15, r = 0.92, p = 0.000)
- Protect 2 hours/week for learning tied to the goal (n=14, r = 0.88, p = 0.000)
- Keep a living FAQ of recurring goal questions (n=16, r = 0.85, p = 0.000)
- Celebrate a tiny win every Friday (n=15, r = 0.84, p = 0.000)
- Provide role-based “what changes for me” cards (n=14, r = -0.84, p = 0.000)

Interpretation
--------------
Positive r indicates higher hybrid% aligns with higher values; negative r indicates the opposite.
